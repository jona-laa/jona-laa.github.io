    bio: "<p>I’m currently studying web development at Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, but I’m based in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p>I like both back- and front-end development, but see myself as more of a front-end guy. I love being able to use both logic and creativity when building projects, which is the reason I fell in love with development in the first place.<p/> <p> I've summarized some of my skills and projects below, so make sure to take a look. :) </p> <p> If you're looking for a developer, don't hesitate to <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-laasonen-974aa617a/' target='_blank'>get in touch</a>!</p>",
